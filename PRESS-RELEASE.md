## Problem ##
Sometimes a map or a yelp or a whatever is just too much damn hassle. Maybe you’re in a new city and just want something close or you’re downtown and just want to know what's nearby.

Sometimes we just need a centralized source of info about what's happening around us.

## Solution ##
